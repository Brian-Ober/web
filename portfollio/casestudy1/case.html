        <h2>Handshake</h2>
        <h4>
            Internships are an important ingredient in starting a professional career. The question is how does a student obtain an internship. Handshake is a program that was developed to help students find internships. This case study aims to determine how well Handshake fulfills that goal from a user experience design perspective.

        <h3>Ethnographic Research</h3>
        <p>
            I conducted ethnographic research and observations with ten college students to figure out how they use Handshake. After conducting this research, I collaborated with a team of people who had done the same kind of research and confirmed some trends I had found.
        </p>
        <h4>Main Takeaways</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Those who have never used Handshake before generally liked the application.</li>
            <li>Those who were setting up their profile had trouble figuring out what information was required and what was optional.</li>
            <li>Those who had a lot of experience with the application tended to prefer different applications.</li>
            <li>The filter function on the job search is sub-optimal.</li>
            <li>Everyone who had used the site only really used it to attempt to find internships.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Other Takeaways</h4>
        <ol id="other">
            <li>Majors of those I interviewed included Computer Science, Herbology, one energy related major, and several undecided</li>
            <li>Several people are not too picky about what the internship is as long as it meets the requirements of their major</li>
            <li>Some juniors barely know Handshake exists.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <h4>Scenario 1</h4>
        <p>You are a college Junior seeking a Computer Science degree. You need to get an internship to graduate. You are a busy student with little time to search for an internship. You have heard of the Handshake application and that it can help you get an internship. Your task is to look for Computer Science internships on the Handshake program.</p>
        <li>Note this is meant to test the sign up process</li>
        <h4>Scenario 2</h4>
        <p>You have signed up for Handshake and now you need an internship that fits your Computer Science major. Apply to 5 internships that accept Computer Science majors.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 3</h4>
        <p>While applying for an internship you uploaded your resume, however, after closer inspection, you found a mistake on said resume. Your task is to upload your new resume and get rid of the old one.</p>

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>
            Based on what I have learned so far, I have preliminary suggestions for the people who run Handshake. First things first, the setup process needs some adjustments, some sections have too many options and others don’t have enough. One example of there not being enough is the fact that you can only choose 5 options for what you are looking for in an employer. The filtering function in the job search also needs work. A simple protype should be set up for the set up process so we can figure out the optimium amount of options for each question.
